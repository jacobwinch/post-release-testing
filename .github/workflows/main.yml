# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
    # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
    build:
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: macos-latest

        # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
        steps:

            - name: setup build number
              run: echo "::set-env name={BUILD_NUMBER}::{$[GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER+17734]}"

                  echo $BUILD_NUMBER
